    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain dal and grind coarsely.</li>
        <li>Heat oil and add jeera. When it splutters, add ginger, heeng, green chillies and saute till the color changes a bit.</li>
        <li>Add dal, salt, garam masala, chilli powder, khus khus, coconut and saute till it's 'fried'. Add about 1/4 cup water and cook till dal is cooked through. Mix in the tamarind and sugar and keep aside.</li>
        <li>Mix baking powder and salt into the maida. Rub ghee/oil into the maida, add water and knead into stiff dough. Rest, cover for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make walnut sized rounds of the dal mixture.</li>
        <li>Break pieces of dough and roll into walnut sized rounds. Roll these flat into 1/4 inch rounds and pinch about 1/2 of the edge all around, leaving the centre thicker.</li>
        <li>Now wet the pressed edges, and place a ball of the filling in the centre. Bring the wet edges together, covering the filling completely, and pinch together to seal.</li>
        <li>Heat oil and deep-fry the kachoris, first over high heat, then over medium heat so that it cook's through, and browns evenly.</li>
