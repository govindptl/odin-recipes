    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Pani Literally translates to water and here the Puris are fried puffed crisp dough balls which are hollow.
        Generally, the water or pani is sour, tangy as well as spicy. This spicy pani is balanced with the addition of
        sweet tamarind chutney.
        <br>

        This sweet chutney is called as Meetha (which means sweet) Pani. The spicy water is called as Teekha (which
        means spicy) Pani. Both are added in the puri along with the main filling which consists of boiled potatoes,
        cooked chickpeas, moong sprouts or a thick dry curry made from white peas which is called as Ragda.
        <br>

        I don't know who invented pani puri or how it came into existence. It is one of the popular street foods in
        India. Whereas in Mumbai, we call it pani puri. In the northern states, it is called Golgappa and in Bengal, it
        is called as Puchka. In Bihar and Jharkand its known as gupchup. So there various ways this street food snack is
        made and enjoyed.
        <br>

        This is an easy pani puri recipe as you don't need to make the sweet tamarind chutney.
        <br>

        The pani recipe that I share is spicy, tangy as well as sweet. However if you want a more sweeter taste, you can
        make the sweet chutney.
        <br>

        This pani or spiced water recipe is my mom's recipe and to save time she would make the pani in such a way that
        it would have all the three major tastes - spicy, tangy and sweet. So all three tastes - teekha, khatta and
        meetha taste in just one pani. Otherwise generally both the spicy chutney and sweet chutney are made separately.
        <br>

        Pani puri is my most favorite chaat from childhood. I used to have them often with my family on the streets of

        and it was something I have thoroughly enjoyed.

    </p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p>
        <em>For the Puri</em>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the semolina, plain flour and salt and knead very well using chilled soda to make a semi-stiff dough. Cover it with a damp muslin cloth and keep aside for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Knead and divide the dough into 4 equal portions.</li>
            <li>Roll a portion of the dough into 175 mm. (7”) diameter circle.</li>
            <li>Cut into 7 equal circles using a cookie cutter of approx. 37 mm. (1½“) to 50 mm. (2”) size.</li>
            <li>Repeat step 3 and 4 to make more circles. Keep doing till the dough is over and you get 42 circles in total.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a deep non-stick pan, deep- fry few circles at a time, and press it slightly using a perforated spoon till it puffs up and are golden brown in colour from both the sides.</li>
            <li>Remove and drain on an absorbent paper and store in an air-tight container. Use as required.</li>
        </ol>

        <em>For the Pani</em>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the tamarind in ¾ cup of warm water for approximately half an hour. Strain out all the pulp through a sieve.</li>
            <li>Combine this pulp with the remaining ingredients except the black salt in a blender and grind to a fine paste using a little water (approximately ¼ cup).</li>
            <li>Transfer the paste into a large bowl, add 3 cups of water, black salt and salt and mix well.</li>
            <li>If you find the water very spicy, then add jaggery and mix well. Jaggery will balance the spice level making the pani sweet-spicy.</li>
            <li>Chill for at least 2 to 3 hours, so that all the flavours blend very well.</li>
        </ol>
